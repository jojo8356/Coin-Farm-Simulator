This project is a simulator designed to estimate the time required to reach a monthly income of **1500 euros** by purchasing birds in the Coin Farm game. Each purchased bird produces eggs, which can then be converted into coins, then gold, and finally euros.
## Goal

The main goal of this simulator is to determine the number of months needed to reach an income of 1500 euros per month.

## Program Structure

The program is organized around various conversion and bird inventory management functions. The main functions are described below.

### Conversion Functions

These functions manage conversions between units (eggs, coins, gold, and euros):
- **convert_gold_to_pieces(gold)**: Converts gold into coins.
- **convert_pieces_to_gold(pieces)**: Converts coins into gold.
- **convert_gold_to_euro(gold)**: Converts gold into euros.
- **convert_eggs_to_pieces(eggs)**: Converts eggs into coins.
- **convert_pieces_to_euros(pieces)**: Converts coins into euros.
- **convert_eggs_to_euros(eggs)**: Directly converts eggs into euros.

### Simulation Functions

- **calculate_monthly_income(inventory, bird_types)**: Calculates the total income generated by birds in the inventory over one month.
- **buy_birds(pieces, inventory, bird_types)**: Purchases birds based on the available coins and updates the inventory.
- **get_all_price(bird_types)**: Returns the prices of all bird types.
- **can_buy(pieces, bird_types)**: Checks if at least one type of bird can be purchased with the current coins.
- **print_inventory(bird_inventory, bird_types)**: Displays an inventory summary, including the number of birds, their cost, and their egg yield per hour.

## Running the Simulation

The program starts with initial variables:
- **pieces**: Initial available coins (e.g., 250).
- **goal**: Desired monthly income (1500 euros).
- **inventory**: Bird inventory (empty at the start).

The simulation goes through monthly cycles until it reaches the target income:
1. **Bird Purchases**: Buys as many birds as possible.
2. **Income Calculation**: Calculates the eggs generated by the birds, then converts the eggs to coins and euros.
3. **Progress Tracking**: Displays the number of months elapsed, euros generated, coins, and eggs generated per hour.

### Sample Output
